============
NZ Buildings
============

The *NZ Buildings* system is used to manage New Zealand's national building outlines dataset. This dataset is published under CC-BY-4.0 `on the LINZ Data Service`_.

Features
========

The Topography team at `Land Information New Zealand`_ built this system and use it to:

- validate building outlines captured via feature extraction
- assign additional attributes (capture metadata, administrative boundaries)
- manually add, modify or delete building outlines where required
- compare a new set of building outlines against existing building outlines and categorise matching, added, removed or related buildings
- manage the lifecycle of building outlines across multiple data captures
- prepare data to be published on the LINZ Data Service

.. _`on the LINZ Data Service`: https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/53413-nz-building-outlines-pilot/
.. _`Land Information New Zealand`: https://www.linz.govt.nz/

Components
==========

- A PostgreSQL_/PostGIS_ database schema for data storage
- A QGIS_ plugin for data maintenance
- A data dictionary hosted on readthedocs
- ISO 19115 geospatial metadata to accompany the published datasets

All of the components build upon other free and open source software. See ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.rst_ for a summary.

Database
========

The database for the *NZ Buildings* system is a PostgreSQL database with the PostGIS database extension for handling geographic objects.

Dependencies
------------

- PostgreSQL and PostGIS must be installed. Supported versions are tested on Travis-CI_ (note the environment variables that show version numbers for PostgreSQL and PostGIS).
- For development / testing, install pgTAP_.

.. _Travis-CI: https://travis-ci.com/linz/nz-buildings
.. _pgTAP: https://pgtap.org/

Installation
------------

First install the project into the OS data share directory:

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo make install

Then you can load the schema into a target database:

.. code-block:: shell

    nz-buildings-load $DB_NAME

NOTE: the loader script will expect to find SQL scripts under ``/usr/share/nz-buildings/sql``, if you want them found in a different directory you can set the ``BUILDINGSCHEMA_SQLDIR`` environment variable.

Upgrade
-------

The ``nz-buildings-load`` script will also upgrade as it currently replaces the existing schema. All data will be lost.

Development
-----------

For development, creating an alias that reinstalls scripts, rebuilds a test database and re-runs tests locally is helpful. 

.. code-block:: shell

    alias buildingsdb='cd $DEV/nz-buildings && sudo make uninstall clean install && make check && cd -'

``$DEV`` is the directory that ``nz-buildings`` has been cloned into.

Testing
-------

Testing uses pgTAP_ via ``pg_prove``.

.. code-block:: shell

    make check

A database called ``nz-buildings-pgtap-db`` is created with some test data in order to run the tests.

Travis-CI_ is used for continuous integration.

.. _pgTAP: https://pgtap.org/
.. _Travis-CI: https://travis-ci.com/linz/nz-buildings

QGIS Plugin
===========

Dependencies
------------

- The QGIS plugin currently requires ``QGIS 2.18.x``.

Installation
------------

The plugin can be installed in the local plugin folder from this repository.

.. code-block:: shell

    make deploy

Development
-----------

Creating a symlink from the repo to the local QGIS plugin directory makes it easy to evaluate changes to QGIS plugin code.

.. code-block:: 

    ln -s $DEV/nz-buildings/buildings $HOME/.qgis2/python/plugins/buildings

Testing
-------

Testing uses Python ``unittest`` inside a real QGIS instance.

Individual test cases can be executed within QGIS by using the `Script Assistant`_ plugin, which will reload a test every time it is executed to allow ease of writing tests and checking their output.

Travis-CI and the `QGIS Testing Environment`_ are used for continuous integration.

.. _`Script Assistant`: https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/scriptassistant/ 
.. _`QGIS Testing Environment`: https://hub.docker.com/r/elpaso/qgis-testing-environment/

Data Dictionary
===============

The `NZ Buildings Data Dictionary`_ is automatically built on every commit to ``master``.

DOCUMENTATION.rst_ details the source code requirements in order create a valid data dictionary.
