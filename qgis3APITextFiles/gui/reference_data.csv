NOTE:
This tool is based on a machine parsing of 
https://qgis.org/api/api_break.html so the result are as good as the 
information there. Also, being a simple parser, it just give an hint were to
look at. It is by no means a complete tool to find all the
possible API incompatibility.

Methods are matched just based on their names and not on their classes, 
so there might be various false positives.
